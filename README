NAME

    Patch::SREZIC::Tk - a collection of patches for Perl/Tk

SYNOPSIS

        BEGIN { $Patch::SREZIC::Tk::VERBOSE = 0 }
        use Patch::SREZIC::Tk;
        use Tk;
        $mw = new MainWindow
    
INSTALLATION

        perl Makefile.PL
        make all test install

    Most of the tests are interactive. To run the tests in batch mode,
    use (Unix only):

        env BATCH=yes make test

    To avoid the widget tests to flicker over your screen, you can try
    the following (Unix/X11 only):

        Xvfb :123
        env BATCH=yes DISPLAY=:123 make test

    This will create a virtual (invisible) frame buffer and run the
    tests in this display.

DESCRIPTION

    Just install this module (none of the original Tk modules will be
    overwritten) and put

        use Patch::SREZIC::Tk

    on top of your script.

    If you set $Patch::SREZIC::Tk::VERBOSE to a true value, then the
    list of patched modules will be printed on the screen.

    Further, C-level (mostly) patches are in the patches directory.
    Please see README.patches.
