NAME

    Patch::SREZIC::Tk - a collection of patches for Perl/Tk

SYNOPSIS

	none
    
INSTALLATION

    perl Makefile.PL
    make install

    Read and apply the instructions of "make install".

DESCRIPTION

    See the file README.patches for a description of the patches.

    Note that it's likely that some tests in t/entry.t and t/listbox.t
    will fail. This is only due to different font sizes and/or
    inaccurate floating point comparisons and may be ignored.
    t/entry.t and t/listbox.t are disabled on Win32 platforms, because
    font sizes are definitely different from X11 font sizes.

    Some patches (like patches/hlist22.tar.gz) are not in the patch
    format and should be applied manually.
