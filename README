NAME

    Patch::SREZIC::Tk - a collection of patches for Perl/Tk

SYNOPSIS

        BEGIN { $Patch::SREZIC::Tk::VERBOSE = 0 }
        use Patch::SREZIC::Tk;
        use Tk;
        $mw = new MainWindow
    
INSTALLATION

        perl Makefile.PL
        make all test install

    Most of the tests are interactive. To run the tests in batch mode,
    use (Unix only):

        env BATCH=yes make test

    To avoid the widget tests to flicker over your screen, you can try
    the following (Unix/X11 only):

        Xvfb :123 &
        env BATCH=yes DISPLAY=:123 make test
	kill -TERM `cat /tmp/.X123-lock`

    This will create a virtual (invisible) X11 server and run the
    tests in this display.

DESCRIPTION

    This is a collection of patches for Perl/Tk. The distribution is
    separated in perl-only modules, which can be used without patching
    the original Perl/Tk distribution, and (mostly) C-level patches,
    which can be applied manually to the original Perl/Tk source.

    To use the perl module patches, just install this module (none of
    the original Tk modules will be overwritten) and put

        use Patch::SREZIC::Tk

    on top of your script.

    If you set $Patch::SREZIC::Tk::VERBOSE to a true value, then the
    list of patched modules will be printed on the screen for each
    invocation of a Perl/Tk program.

    The C-level patches are in the patches directory. Please see
    README.patches.
