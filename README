NAME

    Patch::SREZIC::Tk - a collection of patches for Perl/Tk

SYNOPSIS

	none
    
INSTALLATION

    Extract the source Perl/Tk distribution:

	gzip -dc Tk800.024.tar.gz | tar xfv -

    Extract the Patch distribution:

	gzip -dc Patch-SREZIC-Tk-800_024.007.tar.gz | tar xfv -

    Apply the patches:

	cd Tk800.024
	cat ../Patch-SREZIC-Tk-800_024.007/patches-perl/*.diff | patch -p1
	cat ../Patch-SREZIC-Tk-800_024.007/patches/*.diff | patch -p1
	cat ../Patch-SREZIC-Tk-800_024.007/patches-t/*.diff | patch -p1

        perl Makefile.PL
        make all test

    You do not need to install the patched Tk (after all, the patches
    are unofficial), but rather use the uninstalled directory via the
    "blib" pragma in your scripts (or by setting PERL5OPT or with
    command line switches):

        use blib "/path/to/new/Tk800.024";
        use Tk;

    in your scripts to use the patches.

DESCRIPTION

    See the files README.patches-perl, README.patches, README.tests
    and README.demos for a complete list of patches.

    Note that it's likely that some tests in t/entry.t and t/listbox.t
    will fail. This is only due to different font sizes and/or
    inaccurate floating point comparisons and may be ignored.

    Some patches (like patches/hlist22.tar.gz) are not in the patch
    format and should be applied manually.
